Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

I realized that I miss to make this entrance. It‚Äôs been a long time, so long that I even missed the first year anniversary of my blog. Happy first year anniversary Aech!

In a big portion of this absence I dealt with my exams and finals. I tried (still trying) to create a systemic learning environment for medicine. If I open up a little bit more what I mean by systemic learning environment. I‚Äôm taking all my notes in digital space then I‚Äôm classifying, tagging and connecting them. In this way I reach what I want to learn more easily. Because all the time I‚Äôm revisiting my old knowledge when I‚Äôm learning new ones for better understand that topic. This process is taking too much time without an appropriate systemic environment. So I tried to create one and I‚Äôm happy to say we got their fruits ‚Äì but still needs optimization-

I created this environment in Notion of course. If you want, maybe I write a post about it. I have got some freaky ideas about merge this environment with AI to create amazing stuff. Yes, I meant GPT-3 when I say AI in here. My words not enough to describe how amazing, exciting, and horrifying GPT-3 is. I‚Äôm very excited and I‚Äôm still reading the [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) they published. When I finished, if I have got thoughts to share (definitely it will be), I will write a post about it.

After, when I took my final exam, we came to our hometown. I‚Äôm surrounded by lots of incredible insects, animals, plants. It‚Äôs best place to live except one thing: hazelnut. Do you know how hazelnut harvested? We collect them one by one from gigantic hazelnut branches. It‚Äôs a very primitive activity, it has been done in the same way for years ‚Äì like education system ‚Äì When I see no improve or optimization in a system for years, I go crazy. I have got brilliant ideas for improving but no one listens, and this is frustrating.

Above all this, I‚Äôm experiencing my holiday in the best way. I‚Äôm reading wonderful books. Amazing news ‚Äì I found Gutenberg Galaxy by Marshall McLuhan in a bookshop here. I was trying to find this book for months. It‚Äôs a book that create brainstorms. I‚Äôm listening wonderful songs and try to play them with my ukulele. Thanks to my sister and my cousin to this awesome birthday gift. I examine insects, taking photos of them and learning about them more, they are wonderful! Here are some of the insects that I met.

How this happened I don‚Äôt know but I dove into the poetry world. I mesmerized by them and read more and mesmerized by them more. I want to share a couple of them.

Clint Smith expresses perfectly what I feel in these difficult times at his poem [When people say, ‚Äúwe have made it through worse before‚Äù](https://readwildness.com/19/smith-people)

I found an awesome youtube channel for poetry lovers: [Ours Poetica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv4-yypZ7srAlzk_MQCRaLQ). Thanks to this channel, I discovered Sarah Kay and her amazing works. She opened the gate of spoken-word poetry for me. If you‚Äôre interested in, you should definitely check out her [Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE).

Another mesmerising poem [On This the 100th Anniversary of the Sinking of the Titanic, We Reconsider the Buoyancy of the Human Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-TDMDSerNE) written by Laura Lamb Brown-Lavoie and read by Sarah Kay.

And for now, final one [√ñm√ºr Hanƒ±mla G√ºz Konu≈ümalarƒ±](https://www.siir.gen.tr/siir/s/sukru_erbas/omur_hanimla_guz_konusmalari.htm) by ≈û√ºkr√º Erba≈ü.

As you can see, nowadays I don‚Äôt push myself to be productive, I‚Äôm spending most of the days with nature, my family and myself. Thanks for reading. Live long and prosper üññ

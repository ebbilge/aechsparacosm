Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

I’m like a little article stacker. Every article from every subject intrigues me. So I download them and stack them all in my computer. Then I forget they exist. Every time I open the folder contains these articles, I decide to do a 30-day article reading challenge, but I can’t. But this time (all my failing goals start like this) for 30 days I’m going to share the article I read and my thoughts on it on a private channel in Telegram. Maybe creating a special environment like this, amplify my wish to read articles. 

I love to discover new songs and new artists. So this year I decided to do a monthly playlist for the songs that I discover that month. I created a playlist for January and I’m updating the playlist whenever I found nice songs. You can check out [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/11ccczvRapeL2h2XSz1KJp?si=c8r4_-VvQRqveBlHH7inXQ).

I’m working on some exciting projects with my friends. We’re in the idea stage nowadays but we found a supervisor for our project and talk with awesome people that work in these areas. They’re very supportive and sweet! We applied for a grant for our project a couple of days ago. I hope we get great news. Wish us luck! Maybe these small steps are first steps for our first startup. It’s so exciting and worrying at the same time.

Now that we started talking about worries, nowadays, I’m thinking about the future a lot and I worry a lot what future holds. I’m paralyzing when I thought all the possibilities that can happen. What I choose to do today shapes my future and I’m terrified to make decisions. Unfortunately I’m an overthinker and this makes harder to make decisions. I can’t decide on important matters and I let myself go wherever life will take me. How can people make decisions about important matters of life? What are you doing in this kind of situations?

Thanks for reading! Live long and prosper!

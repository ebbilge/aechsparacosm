Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

This blogâ€™s purpose was keep the track of my learning adventure. In this process I discovered that Iâ€™m not good at this. Iâ€™m an amateur about writing (especially when it is English) In addition, I couldnâ€™t figure out which way is best for tracking and sharing this adventure. Donâ€™t worry! Iâ€™m not giving up. Where is the fun if youâ€™re not pushing the limits? So I decided to try different ways with an empirical approach to find most suitable idea. This means that you can see many experimental things in the following days.

My first brilliant(!) idea is to share interesting things I read or watched or thought about that week, like a weekly newsletter. So the adventure begins!

# Article & Blog posts

* When I first learn about feynman technique, I was fascinated by Richard Feynmanâ€™s approach to learning. Then I started to watch his lessons, videos and read his writings. His way of thinking is really mind-opening. This week I read his essay [The Value of Science](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-value-of-science). His thoughts about science, doubt and ignorance is remarkable. In addition to this, his way of saying this thoughts are remarkable too. It is very poetic.
> If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar. - **Richard P. Feynman**
* Trying to solve the unknowns fascinates me. One of these unknowns is brain. So every project about the brain excites me. Especially ones that about brain-computer interfaces. This week I read about this research: [Novel nanoprobes show promise for optical monitoring of neural activity](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191018181041.htm). I leave here the words of one of the researcher that can be considered as a summary of the study.
> Harnessing the unparalleled multiplexing and information-carrying capability of light to dissect the neural circuitry and decrypt electrophysiological signals has been a goal of neuroscientists for nearly 50 years. We may have finally found a way to do that. - **Ahmet A. Yanik**
* [Why you should have a side project](https://erickhun.com/posts/why-you-should-have-a-side-project/): Recently I think about passive income and side projects. This blog post is encouraged me to make a side project. I decided to think more deeply about it.
* Refugee childrenâ€™s health problem is a very important topic. I noticed that I didnâ€™t pay attention this problem enough until I read this article [GÃ¶Ã§men ve MÃ¼lteci Ã‡ocuklarda SaÄŸlÄ±k SorunlarÄ±](https://insamer.com/tr/gocmen-ve-multeci-cocuklarda-saglik-sorunlari_2424.html). I must research about it.
* Deep learning AIs are amazing. They made most of the things easier and more automated. But they have flaws and pitfalls like everything else. This article [Why deep-learning AIs so easy to fool](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03013-5) examines this topic very well.

# Videos

* Ali Abdaal made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM) about how he uses Notion for Resonance Calender. I mentioned this in my latest blog post about PKM. 
* I like Nathaniel Drewâ€™s youtube channel. His feelings and thoughts about life is similar to mine. His adventure of trying to find himself is inspiring me. You should check out [his videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdWRLq10OHuy7HmSckV3Vg).

# Little updates

* I start to studying in AUZEF Sociology as a second university. This semester I will be taking history of political thoughts, intro the sociology, intro the psychology, intro the philosophy classes. Iâ€™m so excited. I see this kind of education as a big opportunity.

# Events

* Iâ€™m going to Future Science Forum at 2-3 November. Iâ€™m very pleased about chosen topics(mostly from artificial intelligence in health) I hope it will be a good experience. 

Thanks for reading! Live long and prosper ðŸ––

Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

My academic life is more stable and relaxed position after a very long time. In this way, lately I nourish and spoiled myself with learning so many interesting things. I want to share a couple of them with you.

I love the integration of AI and medicine. Creative, amazing people are doing awesome research and innovation in these areas. Finding these researches open my mind to think so many possible ways to integrate AI in different branches of medicine.

This year in medical school, I had the opportunity to see how different branches of medicine work. Inevitably, I looked at the working methods and processes of each branch through the lens of programming. This lead me to notice in what areas using AI, can create meaningful improvement and increase effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment processes. These days, I regularly look at [Doctor Penguin](https://doctorpenguin.com/)â€˜s article recommendations. Checking out this newsletter, seeing solutions other people came up with makes my ideas about AI applications in healthcare more concrete. If youâ€™re interested in this too, you should definitely check out the newsletter.

Speaking of AI in healthcare, professors from Stanford University create a course called AI in Healthcare Specialization in Coursera. It looks very interesting, Iâ€™m planning to enroll. You can access more information about specialization through this [webinar](https://online.stanford.edu/how-bring-artificial-intelligence-healthcare-safely-and-ethically) or from [Coursera page](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-healthcare?).

Iâ€™m taking another course from Coursera. It is about [becoming a social entrepreneur](https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-entrepreneurship-getting-started). I have always been interested in entrepreneurship, but recently this interest has increased exponentially. I am full of excitement and passion to learning new things about social entrepreneurship. Course taught by Michael Gordon, professor of business administration from University of Michigan. The best part of the course is every week Michael Gordon interviews with different social entrepreneurs. These interviews contains so much wisdom and experience. Michael Gordon has a book with the same name as the course also. The book is very interesting too.

Another thing that Iâ€™m learning nowadays is Android app development with [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course?authuser=1). I made little apps for fun before but not serious things.
We are aiming to make our deep learning project more accessible so we plan to make an app for it. To get better at this, Iâ€™m creating apps using Kotlin. Itâ€™s so much fun.

I have a different kind of relationship with the Japanese language. I canâ€™t give up learning Japanese no matter what because Iâ€™m so curious about this language. So I get back learning Japanese again and again. Thanks to [Japanese with Yuta](https://www.yutaaoki.com/lp/jp2/japanese-with-yuta.html) newsletter, my Japanese learning adventure revived. He is very good at teaching Japanese.

As always, I read wonderful things and think about them all the time. You can see what Iâ€™m reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122629806-esra). Nicholas Carrâ€™s Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains is a delightful book from every aspect. If you are wondering how all of technology, from the invention of writing to the invention of the internet, has shaped our minds and way of thinking, you should definitely take a look at this book.

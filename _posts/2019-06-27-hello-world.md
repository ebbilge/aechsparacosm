Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

I am Aech. As you already understand, this is a nickname that I choose for myself. It is a character from Ernest Cline’s book Ready Player One. I’m obsessed with this book and all of the characters in it. This information can say so much about my taste of books and movies. So I skip that part.

I’m 19 years old med student and irresistible computer geek. My biggest hobby is learning new things. It doesn’t matter is it useful or not. Especially I love to learn about computer science, sociology, medicine, psychology, archeology, entomology and list goes on. In this blog I try to share what I learned. This will give me better understanding at what I learned and keep a track of my learning adventure.Yay!

I want to explain why I choose this site name: Aech’s Paracosm

>"A paracosm is a detailed imaginary world. The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions." - Wikipedia

I think in their minds every people create little paracosms. We are huge universes with our experince, knowledge, loved ones, fuzzy thoughts, likes, dislikes and our minds. So this blog will be my paracosm-my mind-my universe’s some kind of projection. Get in and hope you have a good time!

Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

Lately, Iâ€™m in a state that Iâ€™m trying to do so many things but I canâ€™t do even one of them properly.
It feels exhausting and annoying. I need to do so many things. I have got so many books to read, so many posts to write, so many topics to research and study, so many important things to think. I donâ€™t know how to do all of these. Do you have any suggestions because Iâ€™m in the danger zone right now?

I have to do all of these things because there are so many bad things happening everywhere in the world. I have to educate myself properly to make a contribution even one little small thing to get better. I have to learn, be aware of what is going on because making meaningful changes in the world begins by noticing the circumstances. To notice, you need to know.

I need to know but these thoughts, feelings and responsibilities so heavy and I donâ€™t know how to cope with them. [The world is too heavy, too big for my shoulders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKFFLY_bQ6E&feature=youtu.be).

We are in such a rush. I feel like Iâ€™m passing by those meaningful, important and precious moments without even realizing it. This reminds me those incredible words from [Daytripper by FÃ¡bio Moon and Gabriel BÃ¡](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8477057-daytripper)

When I started to think about these, my priorities shifts like crazy. Iâ€™m in such a paradoxical point. I have to learn and do so many things but I have got limited time. So I have to be fast but If I travel too fast all I gonna see is a blur.

Nowadays, Iâ€™m wrestling with these thoughts. I hope I can find solutions. Live long and prosper ðŸ––

Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

We‚Äôre in the first days of 2022 and 2021 was an interesting year in many aspects. So let‚Äôs remember and evaluate what did I do, what did I read, what did I think in 2021. It will be a little disappointing I must warn you. There was so much turbulence in my feelings, in my thoughts. We can say there were lots of ups and downs.

Let‚Äôs start from this blog. I wrote a total of 4 posts this year. It is less than half of the posts that I wrote in 2020. Let‚Äôs analyze the reasons why I wrote so little.

I have still got hesitations about expressing my thoughts publicly in this internet era. So I don‚Äôt want my posts to reach out so many people but I want to be heard too. Because I want to make meaningful conversations with people from different backgrounds. I want to understand their way of thinking, their perspectives. Internet is the best place that I can reach lots of people from lots of different backgrounds (thanks Tim-Berners Lee and the nameless heroes that built this incredible-paradoxical thing called internet) Especially I want to learn which factors affect how we approach subjects. We end up very different conclusions from same things. What is the lead factor that creates these differentiations in our way of thinking? Is it race, is it culture, is it genetics, is it the household that we were grown, is it the books that we read, is it the information that we consume? Probably all of them, because they‚Äôre overlap each other and the borders that divides them very weak. We can find lots of research made on these issues I know it but I want to learn through my experiences. For me the experiences creates mind-blowing and more fundamental discoveries rather than reading publications of research (btw I love to read sociological research papers a lot, if you have recommendations I will delightfully accept it and devour it) The main motivation for writing and sharing my thoughts is based on these reasons. So you may ask, why don‚Äôt you write regularly when you have very good reasons.

This is the obstruction point that I need to cure to write more posts (I‚Äôm in gastroenterology rotation as you can guess) I‚Äôm still afraid of what will people think about the things that I‚Äôm thinking about. Even writing this sentence was absurd, how am I still thinking these? Yeah, in the past we were living in tribes and the most important thing in life was being accepted by your tribe. And right now we are living in a very big society and we can‚Äôt adapt to these changes, we want to accepted by everyone (but right now everyone means billions of people) How can I be accepted by billions of people, do I even accept everyone, please be more logical Aech! This was a brief example, the behind the scenes of my thought processes that I do regularly. I hope I get over this useless anxiety about what others think about me and express my thoughts more bravely in 2022.

I consume a lot of information every day, so constantly I get an urge to share what I‚Äôve learned. Because of this I document my thoughts regularly in the forms of video-essays, podcasts, journals but I never share them with anyone. To remember what I thought this year I watched, listened and read these things. My main theme of thought in 2021 was what will I do with my life, how to live the best way possible. I still don‚Äôt know the answers but I decide to stop being anxious about this. It is a really big improvement for me. We can say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one small step for man, one giant leap for Aech.‚Äù Thanks Dune for getting to support that I need. Nowadays I‚Äôm moving with the flow of the process.

Another recurring theme of thought was my inability to complete my goals. I‚Äôm interested in so many things, so I try to do many things at once. This leads us to burnout and I stop doing everything at once. So I can‚Äôt achieve what I want to achieve. This situation shakes my trust to myself and causes a lack of willpower. The main problem we have to solve here is my problematic interest in everything and my limited attention span. I‚Äôm in a very troubled position, I‚Äôm reading these kinds of stuffs in [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Im-in-my-early-20s-Ive-been-paralyzed-in-action-for-a-long-time-because-I-want-to-do-a-lot-of-things-and-dont-know-where-to-start-Is-there-such-a-thing-as-wanting-to-do-too-many-things-in-life) nowadays wish me luck. I hope I can create a systematic and healthy environment for learning and doing all of the things that I‚Äôm curious about in 2022.

I read so many wonderful things. I can say that the best things that happened this year were the books that I read. I like reading books I love talking about books and more than that I love to listen to people who talk about the books they love. And my nirvana point is to talk about books with people who love to talk about books. All this year, I searched for a book club that I can attend but I couldn‚Äôt find it. Then I tried to start it but it didn‚Äôt go well. I hope I can find a good book club that resonates with me in 2022.

I want to share a couple of books that I love. My most beloved book that I read in 2021 is T√ºrkiyenin Maarif Davasƒ± by Nurettin Top√ßu. He is an amazing thinker, sociologist, and philosopher. His analysis of education and society is mind-blowing, just in place and still up to date. He is not only analyzes the education system but also offers realistic solutions to the problems that it has, and these solutions are still valid. I love to read and think about education and analysis of the education process. If you have a taste like me, you will be love this book. Nowadays I‚Äôm reading ƒ∞radenin Davasƒ±, Devlet ve Demokrasi by Nurettin Top√ßu and this one is wonderful too.

Another favorite book is H√ºseyin Akƒ±n‚Äôs Kaybolmak i√ßin Nereye Gitmeli. It is a collection of essays about life, modern-day problems, poetry, literature, and more. I learned about this book from these wonderful and peaceful [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYSItlKX5X8). Last but not least favorite book of the year is Gertrude by Hermann Hesse. If you haven‚Äôt read Hermann Hesse, you miss so many things. My favorite book from him is Bozkƒ±rkurdu, I recommend that too. His way of expressing and depicting of emotions and thoughts is impeccable. Reading his books is a wonderful experience. I want to express my gratitude to Kamuran ≈ûipal who translates this book wonderfully.

By the way this year I went public libraries a lot and spent hours and hours there. It felt like I have a huge library that I can read what I want. I love huuge libraries ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm not proud to say that I spent countless hours on watching youtube. Maybe I spent half of my year watching youtube. This is heartbreaking. I learned good amounts of things but most of the things that I watched was useless unfortunately. My favorite youtube channels this year are obviously my all time-favorite vlogbrothers, Tom Scott, Aida Azlin, Academy of Ideas, Jake Frew, Simone Giertz, anattynook, unjaded Jade. And special thanks to Ninja Nerd and StatQuest with Josh Starmer to teaching me a lot. This is a bad habit that I need to change so I started to do a video tracker journal. I‚Äôm adding videos that I watched with the information why I‚Äôm watching it and what did I gain from it. It definitely reduced the amount of time that I spent in youtube and I‚Äôm more intentional with what am I watching.

My favorite song in 2021 is Poem of the Atoms II by Armand Amar. I heard this song from amazing documentary the [Human-Movie](https://youtu.be/vdb4XGVTHkE). Well-executed idea with an amazing cinematography. My other favorites are For Lovers by Lamp(it‚Äôs [lyrics](https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Lamp/%E6%81%8B%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%B8/translation/english) hit me in a different way), Slow Dancing by Adam French, Satisfied Mind by Jeff Buckley, lightning by mehro and a lot more.

The biggest achievement of this year was that I started working on my biggest dream. It will be years to becoming real but I know that with Allah‚Äôs will and my effort eventually it will become real. I‚Äôm working on it with full of enthusiasm and joy.

Other things that I did this year:

* My academic life went very well despite the obstacles.
* We got a grant for our deep learning project but it‚Äôs not that a big grant.
* I took university entrance exam again, just for fun.
* I got a driver‚Äôs license.
* I‚Äôm still studying sociology in ƒ∞stanbul University and I fall in love with sociology more and more every day.

Thanks for reading. I wish you a wonderful new year. Live long and prosper üññ

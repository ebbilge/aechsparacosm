Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

I’m not dead! Just, I was so busy with trying to handle life. I had exams and responsibilities. So recently I couldn’t find quality time to spend with myself. (According to 16 personalities test result I’m %79 introvert person. So I need spend so much time with myself to functioning like a normal human being. If this balance breaks I’m break too. This deserves a separate blog post in itself, so I move on.)

It’s been more than a month since my last adventure log. So I’ll briefly write about what I’ve done during this long absence. 

* My language preferences have changed. I started to learn French and paused my Japanese learning. Cause I want to read Emile Durkheim’s books in its original language. Addition to these I’m learning French more quickly.
* I’m teaching programming to three person. It’s very exciting and educative. Richard Feynman is right again. You are quickly pinpoint the holes in your knowledge by teaching someone else.

* I read a few article but only one of them is worth to talk. [Noam Chomsky on Where Artificial Intelligence Went Wrong](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/noam-chomsky-on-where-artificial-intelligence-went-wrong/261637/). I read this article a couple of times and thought on it so long time (still thinking). It is a bit old article but it contains so much wisdom i think. They are not only talk about where artificial intelligence went wrong, they talk about different science branches and how their methods of understanding the complex systems went wrong. For me, the most mind-opening part is the part that they are arguing what is our aim in these scientific researches. 

> **"Do we rely on powerful computing and statistical approaches to tease apart signal from noise, or do we look for the more basic principles that underlie the system and explain its essence?** The urge to gather more data is irresistible, though it’s not always clear what theoretical framework these data might fit into. These debates raise an old and general question in the philosophy of science: **What makes a satisfying scientific theory or explanation, and how ought success be defined for science? “**

* If I can gather my ideas, I would like to write a post about what I think about this.

According to my experiences I notice that I can’t write regularly. So I will continue to share my learning adventure but not regularly. That’s all for now. Live long and prosper!

Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

This week I don‚Äôt have many suggestions. Because I spent all week learning and programming stuff. And addition to these I watched so many episodes of Anne with an E. Unfortunately it was slightly productive week. But we can not productive all the time, aren‚Äôt we? I talked to much. Let‚Äôs move on to suggestions.

# Article & Blog Posts

*  Tim Urban‚Äôs approach and writing style is unusual, original and fun. I love to read his blog posts. This week I read [How to Beat Procrastination](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html) by Tim Urban. Procrastination is a big problem for me. I do nearly everything when a couple of days before its deadline. I hope I resist Instant Gratification Monkey and reach The Happy Playground.
* I read wonderful blog post about Genetic Algorithms ‚Äì[Shakespeare, Maymunlar ve Genetik Algoritmalar](https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkiye/shakespeare-maymunlar-ve-genetik-algoritmalar-a18a09167a30)‚Äì If you ask what is genetic algorithm, according to Wikipedia: ‚Äù Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. ‚Äù And Ahmet Ata≈üoƒülu explains clearly what is genetic algorithm and how is it working. An addition to this he shares source codes of the genetic algorithm that he wrote. I tried the understand and wrote the code. It was so much fun!
* You probably know how important is learning for me. I‚Äôm trying to push my learning boundaries. So I read about learning and searching new learning techniques. This week I read [Learning is optimized when we fail 15% of the time](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191105113457.htm).

# Knowledge Sources

* If you are interested in AI, Alper Calisir has collected many AI sources and made wonderful [AI Pathway](https://calisir.github.io/aipathway/aipathway.html).
* Google created [machine learning crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) for aspiring machine learning practitioners.
* The Metropolitan Museum of Art share five decades of [Met publications](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/) on art history to read, download and search. I was able to look at a few, but even that was great.
* I‚Äôm interested in sociology and computer science. And I want to make projects about intersection area of this two. I find a useful book called [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/). According the author, this book is for social scientists that want to do more data science, and it is for data scientists that want to do more social science. That‚Äôs what I need! So I started to reading. If you‚Äôre interested in these areas you can look at too.

That‚Äôs all for this week. Thanks for reading and as always live long and prosper üññ

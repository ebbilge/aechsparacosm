Hello all organic and artificial life forms,

I found this blog post draft in my archive. I was hesitating to share at the time I wrote this.
But now, I want to share this greatly personal post because I started to notice more strongly that how important self-reflections are. It is a delightful experience to ask bold and though questions for yourself and try to find answers for them.

Attention: This post is full of personal questions for my future-selves. So if you donâ€™t have time or interest, I suggest you skip this post and wait for the next one.

P.S: Future Aechs this attention is not for you because I think you will want to read the questions of your past-self. Probably, this article will vanish in this gigantic sea of data but if you find it please read it.

Hello all organic and artificial life forms and especially future Aechs,

I turned 20 a couple of days ago. Personally, I donâ€™t like birthdays at all because being center of attention is very daunting. Becoming 20 or have lived another year led me to ask questions to my future-selves. I inspired a lot from Tom Rosenthalâ€™s wonderful song [Have We Met Before](https://youtu.be/PoUf7cP61gY) too. As a birthday gift for myself, I thought that I can send these questions every year with timed mail to myself, answer them honestly, and collecting them in one place. These answers will create good data about my perspective about my life. You know I love data, especially data about myself.

I have got so many questions about future, past, and now. If youâ€™re ready, Iâ€™m starting.

Am I on a great adventure? Will I go to space? Will I walk in a spacesuit or wonâ€™t I need one of these to walk in space?

Where do I live? Where do I watch the stars at night? Is there any chance of it being Mars? Or am I alive? Options to consider.

Who do I listen to the most and who do I talk to the most? Who are the most important people in my life right now? What are the most important things in my life right now?

What do I fear most? Can I ask questions? Did my curiosity die? Am I still impatient? Whatâ€™s the hardest thing in my life? Did I learn to ask for help?

What do I study? What am I wondering most? What am I learning? Do I collect and classify insects still? Do I have insect collections? Can I draw insects?

How many languages do I know? Do I play piano or electric guitar or ukulele? I hope I can play one of them. What song that I am listening endlessly?

Did I buy a 3d printer or did I make a homemade one? I need to make this happen quickly because my other projects wait for this.

How is the news about climate change? Are we still donâ€™t understand its importance. How is it going machine-learning projects? Can I beat human-level performance with my codes? What is GPTâ€™s new versions like? Is singularity near? How society adapting to these fast-pace improvement of AI?

What are my favorite books? Why are they my favorites? Did I start to write my sci-fi book? Did my favorite poet change, who is s/he? Did my favorite poetry change? If it changed, what it is like and what it feels like?

Do I aware of my feelings? What new feelings that I discover that I had never before? How do they make me feel?

What am I thinking right now? Am I still think about what others think about me or this is a thing that you donâ€™t think about it when you get older?

What I want? Do I know what I want? Can I say no to people? Did I hurt someone? If I did, why did I hurt someone? Did I solve the problem or am I still hurting someone? Am I aware that I hurt someone?

Did we reveal some of the secrets of the brain? What about consciousness? Do I still amazed by the brain and all of its backdoors? What do I dream of most? Did my biggest dream come true?

What are the most intriguing questions on my mind right now? What questions should I ask for the next year?
